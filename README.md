	This device is a Random Number Generator. It is composed of a 8 bit parallel in serial out seed device. A state machine that the seed device feeds into.If a 1 is inputed the number in the state machine is subtracted by 3 and then modulus 10. If a 0 is inputed from the seed device into the state machine it multiplies the number by 3 and then modulus 10. After that the output is recorded by four d-flip flops and also sent to a 16 bit register where the write address is generated from a synchronous t-flip flop. This device is controlled by a clock.
